Features and Meanings of Data 
=============================

ID_Activity
-----------

Denotes the ID of test subject and her activity when data is collected, there are a total of 30 test subjects with 6 different kind of activities namely 
laying, sitting, standing, walking, walking downstairs and walking upstairs giving rise to 180 different combinations.
For example, an ID_Activity that reads "12 Standing" means data were taken from test subject 12 when she was standing.

Understanding the meaning of different variables
----------------------------------------------------
The main variables in these data (see Reference [1]) come from an accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals 
(prefix 't' to denote time). The acceleration signal was further separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) while body 
linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional 
signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). Finally a Fast Fourier 
Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. 
(Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  '-XYZ' is used 
to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

Thre are a total of 33 main variables

tBodyAcc-in direction X, Y, Z
tGravityAcc-in direction X, Y, Z
tBodyAccJerk-in direction X, Y, Z
tBodyGyro-in direction X, Y, Z
tBodyGyroJerk-in direction X, Y, Z
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-in direction X, Y, Z
fBodyAccJerk-in direction X, Y, Z
fBodyGyro-in direction X, Y, Z
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

For each test subject with each activity, we compile the mean and standard deviation for each main variables

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation

As a result, we have a total of 66 variables for each particular test subject doing a specific activity. Also note that each variable is normalized and
is bounded within [-1,1].
